# modeling_requaypampa_microgrid_viability
This repository provides access to the codes and data used in a feasibility analysis of a microgrid in Raquaypampa, Bolivia, under various socio-economic contexts (SSP5 and SSP1). It contains four files, each representing one of the successive stages in the microgrid modeling process, presented in sequential order.

climatical_part:

This folder contains all the codes and compiled results related to climate data processing for the microgrid feasibility study.

  * Codes:
    - change_factor: calculates the change factor between historical and future climate models.
    - prediction_w_cf_day, prediction_w_cf_hour, prediction_w_cf_month: generate future climate predictions adjusted using the calculated change factor and copernicus data.

  * Subfolders:
    - model: contains monthly historical data and monthly SSP1 and SSP5 futur data for each climate model at Raquaypampa.
    - copernicus: contains the historical observed climate data for Raquaypampa.
    - change_factor: contains the change factor results for each climate model, under each socio-economic scenario.
    - prediction: contains the future climate predictions for each model, along with their averaged values.

demand_part:

This folder contains the electricity demand results for the community under the two socio-economic scenarios. It also includes the codes used to generate these results.

  * Codes:
    - cold_storage: models thermal storage appliances (refrigerators, freezers) that depend on temperature prediction files for each socio-economic scenario.
    - t_ind+fan: models all other appliances that do not depend on temperature predictions, as well as the village fans, which are influenced by temperature predictions.
    - demand_all: aggregates the results from the two previous codes to simulate the villageâ€™s total electricity demand.

  * The subfolders contain the output of the demand_all code, providing annual electricity demand profiles for each socio-economic scenario.

RES_part:

This folder contains the codes and resulting data required to develop the photovoltaic production profile of the microgrid for both the sunniest year (max.) and the least sunny year (min.) of each SSP.

 * Codes:
   - DIRINT: this code decomposes Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) into Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI).
   - PV_model: This code estimates the electrical output of a photovoltaic (PV) panel by combining its specified characteristics, ambient temperature, and the decomposed components of GHI.
     
 * Subfolders:
   - irradiation, temperature: These files provide, for each socio-economic scenario, the maximum and minimum irradiation values together with the corresponding temperature data for the same years. They serve as consistent climatic inputs for simulating the PV production.
   - pv_input: These files, structured in this way, serve as inputs for modeling photovoltaic production using the PV_model code. In them, the maximum and minimum irradiation values, along with their respective temperatures, have been replaced to generate the corresponding PV production profiles.
   - PV_prod: This file provides, for each scenario, the photovoltaic production output generated by the PV_model code. It contains the production profile of a single, predefined PV panel.

microgrid_part:

This file contains the input data required to model the microgrid using the microgridspy tool (https://microgridspy/documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), as well as the simulation results. 

 * Subfolders:
    - Demand_Time_Series and RES_Time_Series: These files, structured as required inputs for the microgrid simulation, contain the hourly profiles of, respectively, the electrical demand data and the renewable energy production data for each SSP.
